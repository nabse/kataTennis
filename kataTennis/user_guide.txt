Kata Tennis :

Coding approach : 

 We used the TDD (Test Driven Development) to undertake this kata. The TDD is an agile appraoch of developing. It consists on :
 
 1 - Writing the unit test and running it to make sure that it fails
 2 - Writing the corresponding code and running test to verify that it passes
 3 - Refactoring the code and running the test again to check that there is no regression

The source code contains three pacakges :

1- kataTennis.test :
	- TennisGameTest.java : Unit testing. 
	 For Each unit test we used the BDD (Behaviour Driven Developement) way of expressing the user stories. The structure of our tests follows this format :
			Assume [initial conditions]
			When [Action performed by the user]
			Assert [The result of performing the action]
	 
2. kataTennis.code.constants :
	1 - Constants.java : Set of constants used in other classes
	
3. kataTennis.code.implementation :
	1 - Player.java : the java bean defining the tennis player with 2 attributes : 
		- name : string defining the name of the player
		- score : object encapsulating the score details
		
	2 - Score.java : The java bean of the score details
		- gameScore : string defining the score of the current game. It could be for a player be : [0, 15, 30, 40, ADV DEUCE]
		- setScore : integer defining the score of the current set. This score follow the following rules :
					- It varies between 1 and 6
					- If a player wins a Game and reach the Set score of 6 and the other player has a Set score of 5, A new Game must be played 
					and the first player who reach the score of 7 wins the match.
					- If the 2 players reach the score of 6 Games , the Tie-Break rule is activated. Each time a player win a point, the score changes as follow:
					  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 (-> 8-> 9-> 10-> …). The Tie-Break ends as soon as a player gets a least 7 points and 2 points more than his opponent
	 	- matchScore : integer defining the score of the match. 
		
	3- TennisGame.java : This class contains a set of methods to calculate the score and to display it
